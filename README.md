# Headunit Revived

# Playstore
I try to bring the app to the playstore! This is my first time and it is very hard to get through all the steps.
The next step is to get a several amount of testers.

Please go to groups.google.com and join the Group: headunit-revived@googlegroups.com

## How to use
**Check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/andreknieriem/headunit-revived/wiki) for detailed documentation, setup guides and troubleshooting!**

### Wired USB Connection
- Connect your Android device (phone) to the tablet running Headunit Revived via USB cable.
- Make sure that Android Auto is installed on your phone.
- Set your phone to Host-Mode if nescessary and select Android Auto
- Click the USB Button in Headunit Revived, find your phone and click the right button to allow connection
- Click on your phone in the list and wait for Android Auto to start

### Wireless Connection (Experimental)
- Open Android Auto Settings on your phone
- Click on Version and then on version and permission and click several to enable developer settings
- Go back to Android Auto, click the three dots on the top right and start the infotainment server
- Now you need to bring your phone and headunit(tablet) into the same network (WiFi). You can use mobile hotspot from phone, or from the headunit or use wifi direct. That doesn't matter
- Go to the WiFi Menu in the Headunit Revive App
- Now you can make 2 things
- First: click on the scan button in the top right corner and let the app find your phone by itslef
- Or: manually add your phones ip address via "Add new" button
  - Go to your phones wifi settings and search for your IP-Address eg: 192.168.1.25
  - Add the IP-Address of your phone and click on it to start Android Auto
  - IMPORTANT: In my tests it only works, if your phone is unlocked AND shows the Android Auto settings page! Otherwise it won't connect

### Wireless Launcher
The app even works with wireless launcher (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.borconi.emil.wifilauncherforhur)
- Go to settings and enable Wireless Headunit Server
- Both devices have to be in the same network (WiFi). You can use mobile hotspot from phone, or from the headunit or use wifi direct. That doesn't matter
- Open Wireless Launcher on your phone and start it manually (or select your cars BT connection for example as a starter)
- The Launcher App will find your headunit a send a connection request to your headunit and start the connection (my headunit in my car has very bad wifi and needs 5 minutes to connect to a hotspot. So wireless in not always a good decision)

### Connect Wirelessly via Intent (Power Users)
You can trigger a wireless connection attempt using an Android Intent. This is useful for automation tools like **Tasker**, **MacroDroid**, or via **ADB**.

**URI Scheme:** `headunit://connect?ip=<PHONE_IP>`

**Example ADB Command:**
```bash
adb shell am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d "headunit://connect?ip=192.168.1.25"
```

## Known Issues
- Often the wireless connection won't start. I need more debugging why
- Handshake failed sometimes and the devices won't connect. You need to try again, restart phone or clear caches

## Next Steps:
- Bugfixing 
  - very important are the connection issues!
  - Non-Fullscreen Mode is buggy (https://github.com/andreknieriem/headunit-revived/issues/49)
- Portrait Mode (https://github.com/andreknieriem/headunit-revived/issues/38)
- Maybe:
  - Android SKD 17

## Known Issues
- **Google Maps in Portrait Mode:** Touch interactions (searching, scrolling) within Google Maps may not work as expected when using Portrait Mode. While visual feedback (like ripple effects) might appear, the map itself may remain unresponsive. This appears to be an internal Android Auto / Google Maps limitation or bug in vertical orientations.

## Original Headunit
Headunit for Android Auto (tm)

A new car or a $600+ headunit is NOT required to enjoy the integration and distraction reduced environment of Android Auto.

This headunit app can turn a Android 4.1+ tablet supporting USB Host mode into a basic Android Auto compatible headunit.
